# My-Course-Projects
These are course projects, I've done during my studies. If you are currently a studeent, I'm glad if my code helps you but,
please do not ask for any help and try to understand it yourself.


VHDL Course:

Implementation of DES encryption algorithm in VHDL and MATLAB. The VHDL implementation contaions both Concurrent and Sequential hardware development methods. Also a Matlab version for verification of the VHDL implementaion was developed, which you can find in the Matlab folder.

CMOS course:

An Specture code and Virtueso schematic, which contains my design of a folded cascode Op-Amp with 140dB gain and 50 MHz unity-gain bandwidth.

Computer Architecture Course:

1. A MATLAB software to analyse assembly code of a MIPS processor for data prediction algorithm.
2. VHDL implementation of IEEE 741 Floating Point Division and Multipication

Computer Vision:

1. SIFT Detector and partially SIFT discriptor
2. Stereo Vision (Both classic and Optimization based)
3. Harris Corner Detector
